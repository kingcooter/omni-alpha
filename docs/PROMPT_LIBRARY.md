## Design Excellence Prompt

**Context**: Used when wanting to level up the UI/UX from "good" to "award-winning"

**Prompt**:
> Ok let's work on design. Right now the site looks cool. Like a cool hobbyist project. Some apps are stunning. Lightning quick and responsive. Beautiful. Original. Inspiring. Fun to use. I want you to make at least a few iterations working on getting the design to a level that it could win awards. In order to do this, you may need to put your Steve Jobs cap on and think about what further strides we should make in terms of functionality, menu options, and UX. If a certain new button makes sense per your design then go for it. I want to really level this up to the point where it turns heads.

**Key Elements**:
- References the current state honestly ("hobbyist project")
- Sets aspirational benchmarks ("stunning", "award-winning")
- Lists specific qualities to aim for (responsive, beautiful, original, inspiring)
- Gives creative freedom ("put your Steve Jobs cap on")
- Allows for scope expansion ("if a certain new button makes sense")
- Requests multiple iterations
- Clear success metric ("turns heads")

**Results**: This prompt led to comprehensive design improvements including:
- Premium CSS effects (gradients, glows, animations)
- Enhanced sidebar with keyboard shortcuts
- Refined widget components with hover states
- Improved typography hierarchy
- Ambient visual effects
- Micro-interactions throughout
